### Contributing Code üíª

#### Types of Contributions

- **Bug fixes**: Fix reported issues
- **Features**: Implement new functionality
- **Performance**: Optimize existing code
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **Tests**: Add missing tests
- **Refactoring**: Improve code quality

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use Git Flow for branch management:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Development branch
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent fixes for production
- `release/*` - Release preparation

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
# Update your local develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ...

# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add amazing feature"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements

**Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add biometric authentication support"
git commit -m "fix(ui): correct password field validation"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
```

## Style Guidelines

### Python Style Guide

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

```python
# Good
class PasswordValidator:
    """Validates user passwords."""
    
    def __init__(self, min_length: int = 8):
        self.min_length = min_length
    
    def validate(self, password: str) -> bool:
        """
        Validate a password.
        
        Args:
            password: The password to validate
            
        Returns:
            True if valid, False otherwise
        """
        if len(password) < self.min_length:
            return False
        return True

# Bad
class password_validator:
    def __init__(self,minLength=8):
        self.minLength=minLength
    def Validate(self,pwd):
        if len(pwd)<self.minLength: return False
        return True
```

### Code Formatting

- Use `black` for automatic formatting
- Use `isort` for import sorting
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Use type hints where possible

```bash
# Format your code
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/
```

### Docstrings

Use Google style docstrings:

```python
def complex_function(param1: str, param2: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Brief description of function.
    
    Longer description if needed, explaining the function's
    behavior in detail.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If param2 is negative
        
    Example:
        >>> result = complex_function("test", 42)
        >>> print(result)
        {'status': 'success'}
    """
    pass
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain or improve code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

```python
def test_password_validator_accepts_valid_password():
    """Test that valid passwords are accepted."""
    # Arrange
    validator = PasswordValidator(min_length=8)
    valid_password = "ValidPass123!"
    
    # Act
    result = validator.validate(valid_password)
    
    # Assert
    assert result is True
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_security.py

# Run in Docker
make test
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Test response times and resource usage

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- All public functions/classes must have docstrings
- Use inline comments for complex logic
- Keep README.md up to date
- Update CHANGELOG.md for all changes

### User Documentation

Located in `docs/`:

- Installation guides
- Configuration reference
- Troubleshooting guides
- API documentation

### Building Documentation

```bash
cd docs/
make html
# View at docs/_build/html/index.html
```
